GarbageCollectorDemo
====================

This is a very simple Mark-and-sweep garbage collector that comes with a demo in GarbageCollectorMain. It is not very useful in practice, but it shows a simple method a garbage collector can work to free unseen memory automatically for a program.

It is well commented, so if one wants to learn about a basic garbage collector can work, they should be able to learn from the code itself.
